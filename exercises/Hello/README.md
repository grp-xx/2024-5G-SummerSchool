Simple "Hello World" application in which the switch reflects the frames it is sent to from the host.
Different versions of the source code are available in the src/ folder.
To setup the emulated environment, compile the p4 code and inject it to the switch, just "make run".
To stop the test, "exit" from mininet, run "make stop" and "make clean" to remove all produced file.
